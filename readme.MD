This GIT repository contains sample code from a Apache Cordova project. Apache Cordova is a framework the allows to create multi-platform mobile apps (Android, iOS, WindowsPhone, etc.).

It demonstrates the use of Javascript/JQuery and JQuery Mobile single-page-app (SPA) paradigm (with a custom theme roller), data-access to a hosted MySQL database, using PHP data object (PDO) with prepared statements with JSON formatted data transfer to/from the PHP backend.

The code can be run from a webserver, but is not meant to be a complete ready-to-use app. It merely demonstrates the techniques mentioned.
